# kafka-aws-weather-pipeline
This project demonstrates real-time data ingestion using Kafka, where weather data from Lisbon is fetched through an API, buffered with Kafka, and passed to AWS services. The pipeline sends data to an S3 bucket, enables query execution using AWS Athena, and applies IAM credentials for secure access.
